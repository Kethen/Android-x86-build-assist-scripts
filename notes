kernel 5.10 can be found https://github.com/maurossi/linux, as well as mesa 20.1.0 https://github.com/maurossi/mesa

kernel 5.10 does not spawn /dev/input/event_ for the touchscreen for some reason
needs to be investigated but here's a work around, add to init.sh
cd /sys/class/input

for f in event*
do
        (
                cd $f
                source uevent
                if ! [ -e /dev/$DEVNAME ]
                then
                        mknod /dev/$DEVNAME c $MAJOR $MINOR
                        chown root:input /dev/$DEVNAME
                fi
        )
done

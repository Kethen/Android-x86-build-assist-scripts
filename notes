finger print check might go off:

vt is opened by surfaceflinger, inputflinger also handles the input from different vts
framework/native/services, look for CONSOLE_MANAGER compile flag

to entirely disable framebuffer console, do it in kernel config FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE VGA_CONSOLE

kernel 5.10 can be found https://github.com/maurossi/linux, as well as mesa 20.1.0 https://github.com/maurossi/mesa
changes has to be made to device/generic/common to use gcc 4.9 for the kernel build, see patch file 0001-Build-kernel-by-target-toolchain.patch

kernel 5.10 does not spawn /dev/input/event_ for the touchscreen for some reason
needs to be investigated but here's a work around, add to init.sh
cd /sys/class/input
for f in event*
do
        (
                cd $f
                source uevent
                if ! [ -e /dev/$DEVNAME ]
                then
                        mknod /dev/$DEVNAME c $MAJOR $MINOR
                        chown root:input /dev/$DEVNAME
                fi
        )
done

suspend can be disabled in /data/local.prop (system/core/init), with property sleep.state (system/core/libsuspend)

system/core/init/property_service.cpp and build/tools/post_process_props.py enforces adb to be on when debuggable is true
